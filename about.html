      <blockquote>
        <p>I was born into an Indian family, spent my early childhood in Saudi Arabia, and grew up in Canada.  
        We moved often—city to city, country to country—in search of a better life and a solid education.</p>

        <p>Those early years shaped me. Being uprooted again and again taught me to see the world through many lenses. It sparked a deep curiosity about people, culture, and the quiet stories that often go untold. That’s where my love for storytelling began—long before I ever picked up a pen, a mic, or stepped into a newsroom.</p>

        <p>I went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto and a postgraduate journalism certificate from Humber College. Storytelling has always been how I make sense of the world.  
        In Guelph, I spent several years as a local reporter, writing over a thousand stories that taught me what makes a community thrive—and the emotions that hold it together. One that stayed with me was about a man who donated part of his liver to a stranger after reading an article I wrote.</p>

        <p>When I moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, I began working in broadcast—telling stories for CBC on television and radio, from breaking news to long‑form features. I later returned to Toronto, where I embraced the fast pace of the newsroom, chasing tight deadlines and quick turnarounds.</p>

        <p>Each move across Canada has deepened my understanding of the diverse cultures that make this country so unique.</p>

        <p>Some of the most powerful stories I’ve found have come from the most ordinary places.</p>
